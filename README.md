Pilau Starter
=======

* This is a starter theme for creating custom WordPress sites.
* It is a child theme, and depends on the parent theme [Pilau Base](https://github.com/pilau/base).
* It also includes other files for a default WordPress installation.

Neither Starter nor Base can be used "out of the box"! There are barely any styles, and many things need to be initialized.

[Pilau](http://pilaubase.com/) is a suite of tools for creating custom WordPress sites created by developers working with the agency [Public Life](http://www.publiclife.co.uk/), is heavily focused on client work there, and is designed as a bare-bones starting point for our projects.

However, we're very happy if anyone finds our work of use! If you feel like contributing, even better.

Pilau is split into a parent theme (Base) and a child theme (Starter) so that Base can be released on the wordpress.org themes repository, allowing easy updates to the core functionality in base (especially security measures and basic functions).
